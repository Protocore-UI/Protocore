Protocore is an open source walking application skeleton for a typical unstructured JavaScript/jQuery web apps. You can use it to quickly bootstrap your unstructured JavaScript/jQuery web application projects.

Prerequisites
=============
As Protocore is based on JavaScript. It is assumed user already knows JavaScript and jQuery.

For understanding Protocore, knowledge of following JavaScript libraries/frameworks are must.
<ul>
	<li>Require.js - a JavaScript file and module loader. For more information visit <a href="//requirejs.org/" target="_blank">requirejs.org</a></p></li>
	<li>Bootstrap Framework 3.0 - a front-end framework for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. For more information visit <a href="//getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">getbootstrap.com</a></li>
</ul>

Installation
============
Assuming that Git is already installed & running:
```
git clone https://github.com/hegdeashwin/Protocore
```

Assuming that Node.js is already installed & running, 

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

To start the development server:
```
node server.js
```
or
```
NODE_ENV=development node server.js
```

To start the production server:
```
NODE_ENV=production node server.js
```

Server layer
============
The server side codebase resides in the ```server.js``` and ```config.js``` files. By default, the server layer is written in JavaScript (Node.js with Express 4.0) which can be configured and flexible to work with any server side scripting language like Java, PHP, ASP.NET or others. As client and server layer are seperate entity.

Client layer
============
The client side codebase resides in the ```src``` folder. This folder contains following subfolders.

```
+-- /stylesheets
	+--/css
	+--/less
+-- /systems
	+--/frameworks
	+--/libs
+-- /templates
+-- /assets
	+--/fonts
	+--/images
+-- /apps
	+--/models
	+--/views
	+--/router
```

Task automation
===============
Protocore comes with Grunt ecosystem - a JavaScript task runner to perform repetitive tasks like minification, compilation, unit testing, linting etc. Many of the tasks you need are already available as published Grunt plugins.

Few task automations has been configured to detect errors and potential problems in codebase and to enforce your team's coding conventions. 

Following are the default Grunt plugins that has been integrated with Protocore codebase.

**Individual tasks**

| Grunt Plugin 			 | Command                  | Task Performed              |
|:-----------------------|:------------------------|:---------------------------|
| grunt-htmlhint		 | grunt htmllint           | Detect errors and issues for HTML documents for index.html and templates. |
| grunt-contrib-csslint	 | grunt csslint            | Detect errors and issues for CSS stylesheets. |
| grunt-contrib-jshint	 | grunt jshint             | Detect errors and issues for JavaScript. |
| grunt-jscs-checker	 | grunt jscs               | Detect unwanted spacing etc. for JavaScript. |
| grunt-contrib-less	 | grunt less:readyMade     | Compile all the less files. The files which comes with third party libraries or frameworks like Bootstrap 3.0 |
| grunt-contrib-less     | grunt less:customMade    | Compile all the less files. The files which created by users as their custom stylesheets.
| grunt-contrib-watch	 | grunt watch 				| Keep watch on less folders & files. Any changes in less file will automatically compile all the less files. |

**Combine tasks**

| Command                     | Task performed              |
|:--------------------------- |:---------------------------|
| grunt default               | Executing this command will perform the task to detect errors and issues for HTML, CSS, JavaScript and less compilation to CSS. It includes jshint, jscs, htmlhint, csslint, less:readyMade, less:customMade. |
| grunt build              	  | Executing this command will perform the ```default``` task including clear and building production build. |
| grunt compileless           | Executing this command will perform only less compilation to CSS which includes two sub-task ```less:readyMade```, ```less:customMade```. |
