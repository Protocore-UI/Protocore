/**
 * Module rules:
 *
 * A Module is a more discrete component of the page. It is your navigation bars
 * and your carousels and your dialogs and your widgets and so on. This is the
 * Modules sit inside Layout components. Modules can sometimes sit within other 
 * Modules, too. Each Module should be designed to exist as a standalone component. 
 * In doing so, the page will be more flexible. If done right, Modules can easily 
 * be moved to different parts of the layout without breaking. 
 * 
 * When defining the rule set for a module, avoid using IDs and element selectors, 
 * sticking only to class names. A module will likely contain a number of elements 
 * and there is likely to be a desire to use descendent or child selectors to 
 * target those elements.
